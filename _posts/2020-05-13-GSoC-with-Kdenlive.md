<h1 align="center"> GSoC with Kdenlive </h1>

Greetings to all. I hope everyone is safe in these crucial times when the true spirit of humanity is tested, and we help those who are not as fortunate as us.

I am grateful to be safe at home, however, this is not the case for many who are stranded in these difficult times.

### **Who am I?**

I am Sashmita Raghav, a first-year undergraduate student pursuing my B. Tech degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence from Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Kerala, India. 
<br><br>
I began contributing to KDE in December 2019. Since then, I have taken part in the Season of KDE 2020 with Kdenlive and have solved a few issues. I began my journey to open source contributions through the KDE community, and I am very grateful for that, as the community has been so supportive to a beginner like myself.
<br><br>
Kdenlive is an open-source video editor based on Qt, MLT, and KDE Framework. The Kdenlive community members have been nothing short of welcoming and encouraging towards new contributors, and they helped me understand and familiarize myself with the Kdenlive source code.
<br><br>
I am grateful to the Kdenlive community for selecting me to participate in GSoC 2020 with Kdenlive. I will be working under the guidance of Akhil K Gangadharan, Farid Abdelnour, and Jean-Baptiste Mardelle.
<br><br>
Videos in Kdenlive are edited by applying filters or effects, however, the application is largely limited in its ability to customize and edit subtitles. At present, subtitles are added as an effect, namely using the Subtitle effect.
<br><br>
This summer I plan to work on achieving support for basic Subtitle customization in Kdenlive by extending the functionality of the existing “Subtitle” filter thereby giving users more choices. I will also work on adding functionality to customize the appearance of the subtitle text like changing the color, size, and font type of the text. 
<br><br>
I will be updating my progress with the project throughout the summer in upcoming blogs and the KDE work report page.

Finally, I would love to express my gratitude to amFOSS, my college student community that has been the guiding light and a constant source of support throughout my journey.
