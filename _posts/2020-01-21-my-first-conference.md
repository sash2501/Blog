## New Year
The new year has been full of new experiences for me. First, my proposal for Season of KDE got accepted, starting a new journey with KDE organisation. An amfoss member then told me about the conference of KDE taking place in India on January 17,18 and 19. So secondly, I got the opportunity to meet the KDE developers in the conf.kde.in held in New Delhi in North India.

Living in Kerala, in the southern part of India where it rarely get cold even in winters, I made the journey to New Delhi, which, being in North India was freezing. It was a learning experience for me as it was the first time I was travelling alone, that to so far away from home, to a new city. Thankfuly, I safelly made it to the hotel in Delhi with the help of the all knowing Google baba and my parents' constant guidance. I was more than ready to attend the conference the next day:)

## Day One : 17 January
Bundled in layers of sweater, I made my way to where the event was being held, Maharaja Agrasen Institute of Technology, which was a few minutes walk from my hotel. The attendees were handed the schedule for the the three days and ID cards.
True to the planned schedule the talks started at 11 am sharp.
