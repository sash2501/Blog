I am Sashmita Raghav, a second-year undergraduate student pursuing my B. Tech degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence from Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Kerala, India.

I consider books to be my closest friends, preferably fictional ones, that act as my escape from the harsh realities of life. I am a proud Dauntless and consider myself to be a member of the Gryffindor House.
